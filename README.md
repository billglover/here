An open alternative to Swarm

## The backstory

I've used Foursquare (and later Swarm) since I can remember. I never understood the need for separate applications, but there are features from the combination that I really like.

- the ability to keep a record of places I've been
- the ability to see places popular with locals and not tourists
- the ability to see safe bets (places where friends have been) when I'm somewhere new

The downside is that I have very little control over who gets access to my data. I'm constrained in how I can use that data. Above all though, it is unclear who else is being given access to my data and how they are using it. I've stopped using Swarm as a result.

## The idea

An open, federated ([fediverse.party](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/)) version of Swarm/Foursquare that I can use to record my location history.

### Basic features

- [ ] ability to see a list of venues near my current location
- [ ] ability to record a visit to at a particular venue
- [ ] ability to see a list of venues I have visited

### Advanced features

- [ ] allow multiple users to use a single instance of the application
- [ ] allow users to add or modify venue details
- [ ] allow users to publish a federated stream
- [ ] allow users to subscribe to federated streams
